##Simple generics class example with one type parameters

We have created SimpleGeneric class, which accepts single type parameter. The type parameter should be followed by class name and should contain with in <>, here T defines the type parameter. 

##Simple generics class example with two type parameters

In this project, I have also shown how to create a simple generics class with two type parameters. We defined two types of parameters called U & V, seperated by ",". You can define multiple type parameters seperated by ",".

##Implement bounded types (extend superclass) with generics 

What happens in case we want to access group of objects comes from same family, means extending same super class? We can restrict the generics type parameter to a certain group of objects which extends same super class. We can achieve this my specifying extends <super-class> at class definitions. Bounded types with Generics implements excactly the same concept
